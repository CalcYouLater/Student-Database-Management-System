# Student-Database-Management-System
Students and administrators can add new student records. Administrators can securely retrieve and delete student records.

If you are downloading the files, some of the relative linking will not work. 
In particular, the CSS files should be migrated to a CSS folder ("css")
and the JS file should be dumped into a separate JS folder ("js")
that are in the same master directory as the other PHP & HTML files. 
Image files should be unzipped into the directory, from pictures.zip.

website.HTML is the main site and serves as a linking tool to other files. 
There are 3 PHP files for adding a new student, fetching student data and logging into the database.
The last PHP file sets up the connection to the students database for the other files. 

Also included is a sample MySQL database used for storing student records.
