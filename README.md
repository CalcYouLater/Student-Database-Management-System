# Student-Database-Management-System
Students and administrators can add new student records. Administrators can securely retrieve and delete student records.

Note: A demo is up an running at this site: http://projectdemos.tk/, with a couple very minor additions.
I added a modal for the project description, accessible through the 'About Project' link at the bottom of the main page, as well as a favicon. 

If you are downloading the files, some of the relative linking will not work. 
In particular, the CSS files should be migrated to a CSS folder
and the JS file should be dumped into a separate JS folder 
that are in the same master directory as the other PHP & HTML files. 

HTML file is the main website. 
There are 3 PHP files for adding a new student, fetching student data and logging into the database.
The last PHP file makes the connection for the other files. 

Optimized for display on Google Chrome.

Also included is a sample MySQL database used for storing student records.
